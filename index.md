# Research

Our research group studies the evolutionary process of diversification. We combine field work, lab work, and computational analysis to understand how variation emerges across biological scales, from genes to cells, organisms, and populations. 

This research spans invertebrate systems, including projects on Hawaiian fruit flies as a model for evolutionary development, sailing jellyfish found at the ocean surface, and life-history trade-offs in insect eggs and ovaries. 

Because our work often involves new technologies and tools for collecting data across species, we also develop and release open-source software for analyzing and comparing large datasets.

### Hawaiian _Drosophila_: model clade for evo-devo

Millions of years ago, _Drosophila_ fruit flies found their way to the Hawaiian islands. Now there are many hundreds of species found on Hawaii and nowhere else in the world.

Given their close relationship to model species like _Drosophila melanogaster_, this group is primed to be a model clade for evo-devo. In our research, we combine next-gen sequencing and phylogenetic comparative methods to uncover their [evolutionary history](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac012).

The central question of our research is: What drives diversification? Hawaiian _Drosophila_ present an ideal system to study this question, given their spectacular diversity in morphology, behavior, and ecology, generated over a relatively short evolutionary timescale.

### Evolutionary inference for developmental data

We develop new tools for evolutionary analysis of gene expression data from [single-cell sequencing](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.01.494334) and other RNA-seq technologies. This work combines mathematics, bioinformatics, and developmental and evolutionary biology to build a new analytical framework.

We advocate for analyzing data in the context of robust [null hypotheses](https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.178004) that describe how much variation we expect to observe when we compare across species. 

The objective of this work is to infer and interpret the [cellular tree of life](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002633). This tree unites species phylogenies, with population maps, geneologies of individuals, and down to cell lineages within a single individual.

### Sailing siphonophore jellyfish in the genus _Physalia_

_Physalia_ jellyfish, known as Portuguese man o' war or bluebottles, are beautiful, dangerous, and mysterious animals found at the ocean surface around the globe.

Sailors, swimmers, and scientists have encountered these animals for centuries, and have learned a few important things: They are colonial, meaning they grow by adding more bodies via asexual budding. They have a muscular sail they use to travel. And they have a powerful, sometimes fatal, sting.

But there is much more we still don't know, including  when and where they reproduce, and how far they actually migrate. We led a [global initiative](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.05.066) to collect _Physalia_ from the world's oceans and found evidence for cryptic diversity, as well as regionally endemic subpopulations. 

### Life-history evolution and insect eggs

Life-history theory describes how traits like size, shape, and reproductive features are related across organisms, and over evolutionary time. We study how developmental biology can modulate these trait relationships. 

In previous work, we curated a dataset of 10,000+ insect reproductive traits like egg size and shape, by digitizing records from the literature. Our team used this dataset to ask questions like:
*   Which insects lay the biggest and smallest eggs?
*   How is egg size related to the development of the embryo inside?
*   What can the vast range of egg shapes and sizes tell us about the evolutionary process?

This work was [published](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1302-4) in the journal _Nature_. For a deep dive on insect egg shape and size, check out our custom [data visualization](/dataviz/index.html)

We also study the organ that makes insect eggs: the insect ovary. Our [publication in _Proceedings of the Royal Society B_](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2021.0150) found that ovary development has a big impact on patterns in ovary structure variation across species.

### Phylogenetic software and methods

Phylogenies are hypotheses about the relationships between organisms. We previously wrote software to statistically compare phylogenies.

We call our software `sowhat`, feel free to [check it out](https://github.com/josephryan/sowhat), and reach out if you need any help using it.

This software has been deployed by many researchers, including our own work on the evolutionary history of invertebrate lineages (e.g. [Cnidaria](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0139068), [Siphonophora](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790318300460)).
