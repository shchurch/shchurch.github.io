## Insect Eggs

Insect lay eggs of all shapes and sizes. I study the evolutionary history of eggs across insects, asking questions like:
*   Which insects lay the biggest and smallest eggs?
*   How is the size of an egg related to the development of the embryo inside?
*   By studying the incredible range of egg forms, what can we learn about the evolutionary process?

For a deep dive on insect egg shape and size, check out our custom [visualization](/dataviz/index.html)

## Hawaiian Drosophila

Millions of years ago, _Drosophila_ fruit flies found their way to the Hawaiian islands. Now there are many hundreds of species found on Hawaii and nowhere else in the world.

I study the relationships between these species, focusing on the their diversity in egg shapes. In this project I take advantage of the fact that we know more about fruit fly genetics than perhaps any other animal, due to the closely related model organism, _Drosophila melanogaster_.

## Phylogenetic Software

Phylogenies are hypotheses about the relationships between organisms. Working with Casey Dunn and Joe Ryan, we wrote software to statistically compare phylogenies.

We call our software `sowhat`, feel free to [check it out](https://github.com/josephryan/sowhat), and reach out if you need any help using it.
