## Insect eggs and ovaries

![picticornis_egg](/assets/img/picticornis_egg.png)

Insect lay eggs of all shapes and sizes. I study the evolutionary history of eggs across insects, asking questions like:
*   Which insects lay the biggest and smallest eggs?
*   How is the size of an egg related to the development of the embryo inside?
*   By studying the incredible range of egg forms, what can we learn about the evolutionary process?

Our work was recently [published](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1302-4) in the journal _Nature_.

For a deep dive on insect egg shape and size, check out our custom [visualization](/dataviz/index.html)

I also study the organ that makes insect eggs: the insect ovary. Our recent [publication](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2021.0150) found that variation in the structure of ovaries across insects rivals the diversity of the eggs they produce.

## Hawaiian Drosophila

Millions of years ago, _Drosophila_ fruit flies found their way to the Hawaiian islands. Now there are many hundreds of species found on Hawaii and nowhere else in the world.

I study the [relationships between these species](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.08.451653), focusing on the their diversity in egg shapes. In this project I take advantage of the fact that we know more about fruit fly genetics than perhaps any other animal, due to the closely related model organism, _Drosophila melanogaster_.

## Phylogenetic software and methods

Phylogenies are hypotheses about the relationships between organisms. Working with Casey Dunn and Joe Ryan, we wrote software to statistically compare phylogenies.

We call our software `sowhat`, feel free to [check it out](https://github.com/josephryan/sowhat), and reach out if you need any help using it.

In my current research at Yale University, I study how phylogenies can be used to understand high-dimensional data in evolutionary and developmental biology, especially big datasets of gene expression that are emerging from single-cell and spatial RNA sequencing. 

In this work, I advocate for building robust [null hypotheses](https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.178004) that describe how much variation we expect to observe when we compare between species. 

# Free English for Adults

![english_class](/assets/img/english_class.png)

I previously ran the Boston-Cambridge English program for adults. These classes primarily serve Portuguese and Spanish speaking adults at all English proficiency levels.
